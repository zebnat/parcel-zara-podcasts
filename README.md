# Podcasts technical test

React Single Page Application that displays a Podcast collection and Podcast details, so you can listen any of the episodes available

The project follows special guidelines for a technical test

## Technologies involved (Project Setup)

I decided to try **Parcel** this time, instead of create react app or webpack a based setup.

I added typescript, tailwindcss and finally Jest and Testing-Library which made me also install babel and presets

## Commands available

- `npm run start`: It will run your app in the default parcel port (1234)

- `npm run test`: Runs jest and React Testing Library to make use of jest-dom

- `npm run build`: Transpiles everything for production
